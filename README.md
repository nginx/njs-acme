![NJS + ACME = Certs!](images/banner.png)

# njs-acme

This repository provides a JavaScript library to work with [ACME](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555) providers such as Let's Encrypt for [NJS](https://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/). The source code is compatible with the `ngx_http_js_module` runtime. This allows for the automatic issue of TLS/SSL certificates for NGINX.

Requires at least `njs-0.8.1`, which is included with NGINX since nginx-1.26.**???-TBD**.

NOTE: Some ACME providers have strict rate limits. Please consult with your provider. For Let's Encrypt refer to their [rate-limits documentation](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/).

## Installation

There are a few options for using this repo. You can build a docker image to replace your existing NGINX image, use Docker to build the `acme.js` file, or build `acme.js` using a locally installed Node.js toolkit.

### Creating a Docker Image
To create an Nginx+NJS+njs-acme docker image, simply run:
```
> make docker-build
...
 => exporting to image
 => => exporting layers
 => => writing image ...
 => => naming to docker.io/nginx/nginx-njs-acme
```
This will build an image with a recent version of NGINX, required njs version, and the `acme.js` file installed at `/usr/lib/nginx/njs_modules/`.

The image will be tagged `nginx/nginx-njs-acme`, where you can use it in place of a standard `nginx` image.

### Building `acme.js` With Docker

If you do not want to have to worry about installing Node.js and other build dependencies, then you can run this command:
```
make docker-copy
```

This will build the full image and copy the `acme.js` file to the local `dist/` directory.

### Building `acme.js` Without Docker

If you have Node.js and NPM installed on your computer, you can run this command to generate `acme.js` directly:
```
npm ci
make build
```

This will generate `dist/acme.js`, where you can then integrate it into your existing NGINX / NJS environment.

## Configuration Variables

You can use environment variables or NGINX `js_var` directives to control the behavior of the NJS ACME client.

In the case where both are defined, environment variables take precedence. Environment variables are in `ALL_CAPS`, whereas the nginx config variable is the same name, just prefixed with a dollar sign and `$lower_case`.

For example, `NJS_ACME_SERVER_NAMES` (env var) vs. `$njs_acme_server_names` (js_var).

### Required Variables

   - `NJS_ACME_ACCOUNT_EMAIL`\
        Your email address to send to the ACME provider.\
        value: Any valid email address\
        default: none (you must specify this!)

   - `NJS_ACME_SERVER_NAMES`\
        The hostname or list of hostnames to request the certificate for.\
        value: Space-separated list of hostnames, e.g. `www1.mydomain.com www2.mydomain.com`\
        default: none (you must specify this!)

### Optional Variables
   - `NJS_ACME_VERIFY_PROVIDER_HTTPS`\
        Verify the ACME provider certificate when connecting.\
        value: `false` | `true`\
        default: `true`

   - `NJS_ACME_DIRECTORY_URI`\
        ACME directory URL.\
        value: Any valid URL\
        default: `https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory`

   - `NJS_ACME_DIR`\
        Path to store ACME-related files such as keys, certificate requests, certificates, etc.\
        value: Any valid system path writable by the `nginx` user. \
        default: `/etc/nginx/njs-acme/`

   - `NJS_ACME_CHALLENGE_DIR`\
        Path to store ACME-related challenge responses.\
        value: Any valid system path writable by the `nginx` user. \
        default: `${NJS_ACME_DIR}/challenge/`

   - `NJS_ACME_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_JWK`\
        Path to fetch/store the account private JWK.\
        value: Path to the private JWK\
        default: `${NJS_ACME_DIR}/account_private_key.json`

   - `NJS_ACME_SHARED_DICT_ZONE_NAME`\
        [Shared Dictionary Zone](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_js_module.html#js_shared_dict_zone) name .\
        value: Zone name used as in `js_shared_dict_zone` directive\
        default: `acme`

## NGINX Configuration

There are a few pieces that are required to be present in your `nginx.conf` file. The file at [`examples/nginx.conf`](./examples/nginx.conf) shows them all.

### Config Root
* Ensures the NJS module is loaded.
   ```nginx
  load_module modules/ngx_http_js_module.so;
  ```

### `http` Section
* Adds the NJS module directory to the search path.
  ```nginx
  js_path "/usr/lib/nginx/njs_modules/";
  ```
* Ensures the Let's Encrypt root certificate is loaded.
  ```nginx
  js_fetch_trusted_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/ISRG_Root_X1.pem;
  ```
* Load `acme.js` into the `acme` namespace.
  ```nginx
  js_import acme from acme.js;
  ```
* Configure a DNS resolver for NJS to use.
  ```nginx
  resolver 127.0.0.11 ipv6=off; # docker-compose
  ```
* Configure a [Shared Dictionary Zone](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_js_module.html#js_shared_dict_zone) to use.\
  Set zone size to be enough to store all certs and keys. e.g. 1MB should be enough to store 100 certs/keys
  ```nginx
  js_shared_dict_zone zone=acme:1m
  ```
  * NOTE: If you want to use a different `js_shared_dict_zone` name, then you need to define the variable `$njs_acme_shared_dict_zone_name` with the name you would like to use.
    ```nginx
    js_var $njs_acme_shared_dict_zone_name acme;
    ```

### `server` Section(s)
* Set your email address to use to configure your ACME account. This may also
be defined with the environment variable `NJS_ACME_ACCOUNT_EMAIL`.
  ```nginx
  js_var $njs_acme_account_email test@example.com;
  ```
* Set the hostname or hostnames (space-separated) to generate the certificate.
This may also be defined with the environment variable `NJS_ACME_SERVER_NAMES`.
  ```nginx
  js_var $njs_acme_server_names 'proxy.nginx.com proxy2.nginx.com';
  ```
* Set and use variables to hold the certificate and key paths using Javascript.
  ```nginx
  js_set $dynamic_ssl_cert acme.js_cert;
  js_set $dynamic_ssl_key acme.js_key;

  ssl_certificate data:$dynamic_ssl_cert;
  ssl_certificate_key data:$dynamic_ssl_key;
  ```

### `location` Blocks
* Location to handle ACME challenge requests.
  ```nginx
  location ~ "^/\.well-known/acme-challenge/[-_A-Za-z0-9]{22,128}$" {
    js_content acme.challengeResponse;
  }
  ```
* Named location to contain the `js_periodic` directive to automatically
request or renew certificates if necessary.
  ```nginx
  location @acmePeriodicAuto {
    js_periodic acme.clientAutoMode interval=1m;
  }
  ```

## Advanced
### Serving challenges directly from disk (not via njs)
  If you do not wish to use `js_content acme.challengeResponse` to respond to challenge requests, then you can serve them directly with NGINX. Just be sure that the `root` directive value in your location block matches the value of `$njs_acme_challenge_dir`.

  ```nginx
  server {
    js_var $njs_acme_challenge_dir /etc/nginx/njs-acme/challenge;
    <...>
    location ~ "^/\.well-known/acme-challenge/[-_A-Za-z0-9]{22,128}$" {
      default_type "text/plain";
      root /etc/nginx/njs-acme/challenge/;
    }

  ```

## Development

This project uses Babel and Rollup to compile TypeScript sources into a single JavaScript file for `njs`. It uses Mocha with nginx-testing for running integration tests against the NGINX server. This project uses [njs-typescript-starter](https://github.com/jirutka/njs-typescript-starter/tree/master) to write NJS modules and integration tests in TypeScript.

The ACME RESTful client is implemented using [ngx.fetch](http://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/reference.html#ngx_fetch), [crypto API](http://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/reference.html#builtin_crypto), [PKI.js](https://pkijs.org/) APIs in the NJS runtime.

### With Docker

There is a `docker-compose.yml` file in the project root directory that brings up an ACME server, a challenge server, a Node.js container for rebuilding the `acme.js` file when source files change, and an NGINX container. The built `acme.js` file is shared between the Node.js and NGINX containers. The NGINX container will reload when the `acme.js` file changes.

To start up the development environment with docker compose, run the following:

    make docker-devup

If you use VSCode or another devcontainer-compatible editor, then run the following:

    code .

Choose to "Reopen in container" and the services specified in the `docker-compose.yml` file will start. Editing and saving source files will trigger a rebuild of the `acme.js` file, and NGINX will reload its configuration.

### Without Docker

To follow these steps, you will need to have Node.js version 14.15 or greater installed on your system.

1. Install dependencies:

        npm ci

2. Start the watcher:

        npm run watch

3. Edit the source files. When you save a change, the watcher will rebuild `./dist/acme.js` or display errors.


## Testing

### With Docker

1. Start a test environment in Docker:

        make docker-devup

2. Optionally you can watch for `nginx` log file in a separate shell:

        docker compose logs -f nginx

3. When started initially, nginx would not have certificates at all (`$njs_acme_dir`, e.g. `/etc/nginx/njs-acme/`), so we can issue a new one by sending an HTTP request to a location with the `js_content` handler:

        curl -vik --resolve proxy.nginx.com:8000:127.0.0.1 http://proxy.nginx.com:8000/acme/auto

4. Send an HTTP request to nginx running in Docker:

        curl -vik --resolve proxy.nginx.com:8000:127.0.0.1 http://proxy.nginx.com:8000/

5. Send an HTTPS request to nginx running in Docker to test a new certificate:

        curl -vik --resolve proxy.nginx.com:4443:127.0.0.1 https://proxy.nginx.com:4443

6. Test with `openssl`:

        openssl s_client -servername proxy.nginx.com -connect localhost:4443 -showcerts

7. Display content of certificates

        docker compose exec -it nginx ls -la /etc/nginx/njs-acme/

The [docker-compose](./docker-compose.yml) file uses volumes to persist artifacts (account keys, certificate, keys). Additionally, [letsencrypt/pebble](https://github.com/letsencrypt/pebble) is used for testing in Docker, so you don't need to open up port 80 for challenge validation.


## Build Your Own Flows

If the reference implementation does not meet your needs, then you can build your own flows using this project as a library of convenience functions.

Look at `clientAutoMode` in [`src/index.ts`](./src/index.ts) to see how you can use the convenience functions to build a ACME client implementation.
