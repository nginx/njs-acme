# njs-acme

This repository provides a JavaScript library to work with [ACME](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555) providers such as Let's Encrypt for [NJS](https://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/). The source code is compatible with the `ngx_http_js_module` runtime. This allows for the automatic generation and renewal of TLS/SSL certificates for NGINX.

Requires at least `njs-0.8.2`, which is included with NGINX since `nginx-1.25.3`.

NOTE: Some ACME providers have strict rate limits. Please consult with your provider. For Let's Encrypt refer to their [rate-limits documentation](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/).

## Installation

There are a few ways of using this repo. You can:
* build an ACME-enabled Docker image to replace your existing NGINX image
* use Docker to build the `acme.js` file to use with your NGINX installation
* build `acme.js` using a locally installed Node.js toolkit to use with your NGINX installation

Each option above is detailed in each section below.

### Creating a Docker Image
To create an Nginx+NJS+njs-acme Docker image, simply run:
```
% make docker-build
...
 => exporting to image
 => => exporting layers
 => => writing image ...
 => => naming to docker.io/nginx/nginx-njs-acme
```
This will build an image with a recent version of NGINX, required njs version, and the `acme.js` file installed at `/usr/lib/nginx/njs_modules/`.

The image will be tagged `nginx/nginx-njs-acme`, where you can use it in place of a standard `nginx` image.

When running the container, we advise mounting the `/etc/nginx/njs-acme/` directory in a Docker volume so that the cert/key are retained between deployments of your `nginx` container. The `docker-compose.yml` file in this directory shows an example of doing this using the `certs` volume.

### Building `acme.js` With Docker

If you want to use your own NGINX installation and do not want to have to worry about installing Node.js and other build dependencies, then you can run this command:
```
make docker-copy
```

This will build the full image and copy the `acme.js` file to the local `dist/` directory. You can then include this file in your NGINX deployments.

### Building `acme.js` Without Docker

If you have Node.js and NPM installed on your computer, you can run this command to generate `acme.js` directly:
```
make build
```

This will generate `dist/acme.js`, where you can then integrate it into your existing NGINX / NJS environment.

## Configuration Variables

You can use environment variables _or_ NGINX `js_var` directives to control the behavior of the `njs-acme`.

In the case where both are defined, environment variables take precedence. Environment variables are in `ALL_CAPS`, whereas the nginx config variable is the same name, just prefixed with a dollar sign and `$lower_case`.

For example, `NJS_ACME_SERVER_NAMES` (env var) is the same as `$njs_acme_server_names` (js_var).

### Staging by Default

The value of the variable `NJS_ACME_DIRECTORY_URI` (`js_var $njs_acme_directory_uri`) defaults to Let's Encrypt's _Staging_ environment. When you are finished testing with their staging environment, you will need to define/change the value of this to your ACME provider's production environment. In Let's Encrypt's case the production URL is `https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory`.

You will need to remove the staging certificate from your NGINX server's filesystem when changing from staging to production. It is located in `/etc/nginx/njs-acme/` by default (controlled by the variable `NJS_ACME_DIR`).

## NGINX Configuration

There are a few pieces that are required to be present in your `nginx.conf` file. The file at [`examples/nginx.conf`](./examples/nginx.conf) shows them all.

NOTE: The examples here use `js_var` for configuration variables, but keep in mind you can use the equivalent environment variables instead if that works better in your environment. See the Configuration Variables section above for specifics.

### `nginx.conf` Root
* Ensures the NJS module is loaded.
   ```nginx
  load_module modules/ngx_http_js_module.so;
  ```

### `http` Section
* Adds the NJS module directory to the search path.
  ```nginx
  js_path "/usr/lib/nginx/njs_modules/";
  ```
* Ensures a root certificate bundle is loaded into NJS.
  ```nginx
  js_fetch_trusted_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/ISRG_Root_X1.pem;
  ```
* Load `acme.js` into the `acme` namespace.
  ```nginx
  js_import acme from acme.js;
  ```
* Configure a DNS resolver for NJS to use.
  ```nginx
  resolver 127.0.0.11 ipv6=off; # docker-compose
  ```
* Configure a [Shared Dictionary Zone](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_js_module.html#js_shared_dict_zone) to use.\
  Set zone size to be enough to store all certs and keys. e.g. 1MB should be enough to store 100 certs/keys
  ```nginx
  js_shared_dict_zone zone=acme:1m
  ```
  * NOTE: If you want to use a different `js_shared_dict_zone` name, then you need to define the variable `$njs_acme_shared_dict_zone_name` with the name you would like to use. You can also use the environment variable `NJS_ACME_SHARED_DICT_ZONE_NAME`.
    ```nginx
    js_var $njs_acme_shared_dict_zone_name acme;
    ```

### `server` Section(s)
* Set your email address to use to configure your ACME account. This may also
be defined with the environment variable `NJS_ACME_ACCOUNT_EMAIL`.
  ```nginx
  js_var $njs_acme_account_email test@example.com;
  ```
* Set the hostname or hostnames (space-separated) to generate the certificate.
This may also be defined with the environment variable `NJS_ACME_SERVER_NAMES`.
  ```nginx
  js_var $njs_acme_server_names 'proxy.nginx.com proxy2.nginx.com';
  ```
* Set and use variables to hold the certificate and key paths using Javascript.
  ```nginx
  js_set $dynamic_ssl_cert acme.js_cert;
  js_set $dynamic_ssl_key acme.js_key;

  ssl_certificate data:$dynamic_ssl_cert;
  ssl_certificate_key data:$dynamic_ssl_key;
  ```

### `location` Blocks
* Location to handle ACME challenge requests. This must be accessible from the ACME server - in most cases this means accessbile from another host on the Internet if you are using a service like Let's Encrypt.
  ```nginx
  location ~ "^/\.well-known/acme-challenge/[-_A-Za-z0-9]{22,128}$" {
    js_content acme.challengeResponse;
  }
  ```
* Named location to contain the `js_periodic` directive to automatically request or renew certificates if necessary.

  > NOTE: This runs at the *end* of each interval, so your server will not be ready for a minute. If this is a problem for your use case, see the ALTERNATIVE below.
  ```nginx
  location @acmePeriodicAuto {
    js_periodic acme.clientAutoMode interval=1m;
  }
  ```
  ALTERNATIVE: The `js_periodic` command runs *after* the interval period has elapsed, not at the beginning. If your use case requires immediate certificate provisioning, then use the following `location {}` block **instead**. This location exposes the endpoint `/acme/auto`, which triggers the certificate provisioning process when requested.
  ```nginx
  location = /acme/auto {
    allow 127.0.0.1; # Adjust for your needs
    deny all;
    js_periodic acme.clientAutoMode interval=1m;
    js_content acme.clientAutoModeHTTP;
  }
  ```

  Use one location block or the other.

## Development

This project uses Babel and Rollup to compile TypeScript sources into a single JavaScript file for `njs`. It uses Mocha with nginx-testing for running integration tests against the NGINX server. This project uses [njs-typescript-starter](https://github.com/jirutka/njs-typescript-starter/tree/master) to write NJS modules and integration tests in TypeScript.

The ACME RESTful client is implemented using [ngx.fetch](http://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/reference.html#ngx_fetch), [crypto API](http://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/reference.html#builtin_crypto), [PKI.js](https://pkijs.org/) APIs in the NJS runtime.

### With Docker

There is a `docker-compose.yml` file in the project root directory that brings up an ACME server, a challenge server, a Node.js container for rebuilding the `acme.js` file when source files change, and an NGINX container. The built `acme.js` file is shared between the Node.js and NGINX containers. The NGINX container will reload when the `acme.js` file changes.

#### VSCode Devcontainer

If you use VSCode or another devcontainer-compatible editor, then run the following:
```
code .
```

Choose to "Reopen in container" and the services specified in the `docker-compose.yml` file will start. Editing and saving source files will trigger a rebuild of the `acme.js` file, and NGINX will reload its configuration.

#### Docker Compose

If you just want to start the development environment using Docker (no devcontainer) then run:
```
make docker-devup
```


### Without Docker

To follow these steps, you will need to have Node.js version 14.15 or greater installed on your system.

1. Install dependencies:
    ```
    npm ci
    ```

2. Start the watcher:
    ```
    npm run watch
    ```

3. Edit the source files. When you save a change, the watcher will rebuild `./dist/acme.js` or display errors.


## Testing

### With Docker

1. Start a test environment in Docker:

       make docker-devup

2. Optionally you can watch for `nginx` log file in a separate shell:

       docker compose logs -f nginx

3. When started initially, nginx will not have certificates at all. If you use the [example config](examples/nginx.conf), you will need to wait one minute for the `js_periodic` directive to invoke `acme.clientAutoMode` to create the certificate.

4. Send an HTTP request to nginx running in Docker:

       curl -vik --resolve proxy.nginx.com:8000:127.0.0.1 http://proxy.nginx.com:8000/

5. Send an HTTPS request to nginx running in Docker to test a new certificate:

       curl -vik --resolve proxy.nginx.com:4443:127.0.0.1 https://proxy.nginx.com:4443

6. Test with `openssl`:

       openssl s_client -servername proxy.nginx.com -connect localhost:4443 -showcerts

7. Display content of certificates

       docker compose exec -it nginx ls -la /etc/nginx/njs-acme/

The [docker-compose](./docker-compose.yml) file uses volumes to persist artifacts (account keys, certificate, keys). Additionally, [letsencrypt/pebble](https://github.com/letsencrypt/pebble) is used for testing in Docker, so you don't need to open up port 80 for challenge validation.


## Build Your Own Flows

If the reference implementation does not meet your needs, then you can build your own flows using this project as a library of convenience functions.

Look at `clientAutoMode` in [`src/index.ts`](./src/index.ts) to see how you can use the convenience functions to build a ACME client implementation. There are some additional methods in [`src/examples.ts`](./src/examples.ts) showing how to use the ACME account creation APIs or generating Certificate Signing Requests on demand.
